[[image-configuration]]
= Image configuration

The plugin's configuration is centered around _images_. These are
specified for each image within the `<images>` element of the
configuration with one `<image>` element per image to use.

The `<image>` element can contain the following sub elements:

include::image/_configuration.adoc[]

Either a `<build>` or `<run>` section must be present. These are explained in details in the corresponding goal sections.

include::image/_example.adoc[]

When only a single image is build with Dockerfile, no need to provide too much parameters in configuration. ImageConfiguration can be dynamically built with the given defaults.

include::image/_simple_configuration_example.adoc[]

It requires a single Dockerfile to be in the base directory or `/src/main/docker`.The image name would default to `${project.groupId}/${project.artifactId}:${project.version}`, but this can be configured with a `docker.autoConfiguration.imageName` flag
